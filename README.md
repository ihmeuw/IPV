IPV SDG Estimates - 2021
This is repository contains cleaned code used to produce results for the IPV SDG indicator 5.2.1, the proportion of age-standardized prevalence of ever-partnered women ages 15 years and older who experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the last 12 months. Progress on this indicator is reported as index values (scaled 0 to 100) which cover 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021.

Additional Info
Data analyzed and generated as part of this effort will be available on IHME's Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) page.
The modeling approach uses Spatiotemporal Gaussian Process Regression (ST-GPR), and the source code for this strategy can be found [here](https://github.com/ihmeuw/ihme-modeling/tree/main/gbd_2019/risk_factors_code/st_gpr).
